# distractionblocker

Welcome to the distraction blocker repository!

Distraction blocker is a productivity application for desktops to help students and professionals focus on their study or work sessions. 
Distraction Blocker does this by restricting your access to potential distracting websites of your choice for a self defined ammount of time.

Interested in contributing to this project? fork a respository and suggest improvments or bug fixes under the issues section. I look forward to working with you.
